# Accessibility Statement

**Team Creative Batang** strives to ensure that its digital services are accessible to people with disabilities. **Team Creative Batang** has invested significant resources to help ensure access for all users, including people with disabilities, with the strong belief that every person has the right to live with dignity, equality, comfort and independence.

Digital accessibility is not just a target we aim to achieve, but an ongoing commitment that we carry in every aspect of our digital service delivery. We recognize that this requires continuous monitoring, improvement, and adaptation. In the sections below, we elaborate on the various efforts that have been undertaken to address our progress in ensuring digital accessibility for all.

A key element of our accessibility initiative is our engagement with a third-party accessibility consulting organization UserWay to help bring the website into conformance. We use industry standard accessibility methods and tools to accomplish this, in accordance with the relevant version of [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) as set forth by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) the internetâ€™s main international standards-setting organization.
